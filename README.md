# programming-for-data-analytics

By: Grace Mary Smyth

Lecturer: Andrew Beatty

This is the readme for the main folder for the module Programming for Data Analytics. 
This folder contains three subfolders:
1. Assignments.
This folder contains the small practical assignments (50%)
2. Project. 
This folder contains the big or main project. (50%)
3. My-work.
Any work completed during the module that is not part of the assignment or project.

Assignments contained in this folder:
a) assignment2-weather.ipynb
    Create a Jupyter notebook called assignment2-weather.ipynb that has a nice plot of the temperature over time ("dryBulbTemperature_Celsius").
b) assignment03-pie.ipynb
    A pie chart of 1000 people's email domains in the CSV file at the URL:
    https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download
    Note: There was no assignment 4
c) assignment_5_risk.ipynb
    The program should simulate 1000 individual battle rounds based on the board game Risk (3 attackers vs 2 defenders) and plot the result.
d) assignment_6_Weather.ipynb
    Get the data from the link:
    https://cli.fusio.net/cli/climate_data/webdata/hly4935.csv
    Plot:
    - The temperature
    - The mean temperature each day
    - The mean temperature for each month 
    - The windspeed (there is data missing from this column)
    - The rolling windspeed (say over 24 hours)
    - The max windspeed for each day
    - The monthly mean of the daily max windspeeds    

In the folder "Big_project" my notebook for the big project and the CSV file of the dataset. 
As set by lecturer Andrew Beatty:
"Write a notebook that demonstrates that you can perform data analysis on some data." I chose the dataset to do with birth rates for 2022 and 2023 from the Central Statistics Office. This was saved to a CSV file which is contained in the folder "Big_project." A number of analyses were conducted within the notebook.

The folder "Big_project" contains three files:
**birth records 2022-23.csv**
This is the CSV file used in the main body of the assessment.
**cso-data**
This is a CSV file of vaccination records which I looked at but didn't utilize in the assignment.
**birth_rates.ipynb**
The Jupyter notebook containing the body of the assignment.

An attempt was made with a machine learning perspective but was ultimately unsuccessful. Further study is required.

A suggestion is made for a further project/analysis.

References for this project are contained within the notebook.
