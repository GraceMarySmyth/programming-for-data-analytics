By: Grace Mary Smyth

Lecturer: Andrew Beatty

This is the readme for the main folder for the module Programming for Data Analytics. 
This folder contains three sub folders:
1. Assignments.
This folder contains the small practical assignments (50%)
2. Project. 
This folder contains the big or main project. (50%)
3. My-work.
Any work conmpleted during the module that is not part of the assignment or project.



!. Assignments contained in this folder:
    a) assignment2-weather.ipynb
        Create a jupyter notebook called assignment2-weather.ipynb that has a nice plot of the temperature over time ( "dryBulbTemperature_Celsius" ). 
    b) assignment03-pie.ipynb
        A pie chart of 1000 peoples email domains in the csv file at the url
        https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1AWPf-pJodJKeHsARQK_RHiNsE8fjPCVK&export=download
       Note: There was no assignment 4
    c) assignment_5_risk.ipynb
           The program should simulates 1000 individual battle rounds based on the board game Risk (3 attacker vs 2 defender) and plots the result.
     d) assignment_6_Weather.ipynb
          Get the data from the link:
            https://cli.fusio.net/cli/climate_data/webdata/hly4935.csv
            Plot:
            The temperature
            The mean temperature each day
            The mean temperature for each month 
            The Windspeed (there is data missing from this column)
            The rolling windspeed (say over 24 hours)
            The max windspeed for each day
            The monthly mean of the daily max windspeeds    


In the folder "Big_project" my notbook for the big project and the CSV file of the data set. 
As set by lecturer Andrew Beatty:
"Write a notbook that demonstrates that you can perform data analysis on some data" I chose the data set to do with birth rates for 2022 and 2023 from the Central Statistics office. This was saved to a CSV file which is contained in the folder "Big_project" A number of analysis was conducted with the analysis within the Notbook. 

The folder "Big_project" contains three files:
**birth records 2022-23.csv**
This is the csv file used in the main body of the assessment.
**cso-data**
this is a csv file of vaccination records which I looked at but didnt utilise in the assignment.
**birth_rates.ipynb**
The juypter notebbok containing the body of the assignment. 

An attempt was made with a machine learning perspective but was ultimately unsuccessful. Further study is required. 

A suggestion is made for a further project/analysis.
